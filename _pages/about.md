<!-- I recently graduated from the University of Washington, with a specialization in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. During my time there, I served as a Research Assistant at the [Control and Trustworthy Robotics Lab](https://depts.washington.edu/ctrl/) under the guidance of [Prof. Karen Leung](https://www.aa.washington.edu/facultyfinder/karen-leung). -->

I am pursuing a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, Riverside, under the supervision of [Prof. Ioannis Karamouzas](https://people.computing.clemson.edu/~ioannis/). As a member of the [Motion Planning Lab](https://motion-lab.github.io/index.html), my research focuses on social robot navigation, where I aim to develop advanced algorithms for safe and efficient robot movement in human-populated environments.

I recently graduated from the University of Washington, where I specialized in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. During my time there, I served as a Research Assistant at the [Control and Trustworthy Robotics Lab](https://depts.washington.edu/ctrl/) under the guidance of [Prof. Karen Leung](https://www.aa.washington.edu/facultyfinder/karen-leung). My previous research centered on fusing thermal and visual images to create richer, more meaningful imagery. These enhanced images have applications in various fields, including Search and Rescue missions and Autonomous Driving Systems, particularly in challenging environmental conditions where stand-alone cameras may not perform optimally.

Before joining the University of Washington, I worked as a Senior Research Engineer at Mahindra Research Valley, India, where I was a part of the Powertrain Development Team and contributed to the development and calibration of controls for Internal Combustion Engines in SUVs.

My research focuses on fusing the thermal and visual images together to get a richer and more meaningful image to be used in several applications, such as Search and Rescue missions and Autonomous Driving Systems, where the environmental conditions may limit the functioning of the stand-alone camera. -->
