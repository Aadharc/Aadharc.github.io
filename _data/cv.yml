      institution: University of Washington, Seattle
      year: June 2022 - Present
      description:
        - Fused thermal and visual images (Multi‑modal data) utilizing the autoencoder architecture with mutual cross attention at the bottleneck, in
          an unsupervised manner for the human detection in search and rescue missions.

    - title: Senior Research Engineer
      institution: Mahindra Research Valley, India
      year: 2017 - 2021
      description:
        - Devised a neural network based DOC (Diesel Oxidation Catalyst) plant model using PyTorch & researched on DOC thermal mapping to control
          and optimize fuel required to regenerate the DPF to increase the fuel efficiency for the engine.
        - Optimized the combustion parameters for Diesel Engines by working on Design of Experiments (DOE) to maximize the temperature of exhaust
          gas entering DOC (Diesel Oxidation Catalyst) to generate a suitable environment for DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter) regeneration. 
        - Improved regeneration interval (+100Kms) and fuel efficiency by carrying out winter validation of BS6 SUV at Manali, India. Effectively analysed
          the collected data using Python and other tools and gave further inputs to solidify the calibration.

      year: Jan 2022 - Jun 2022
      description: 
        - Built an AI‑camera(OAK‑D) enabled controller with depth perception and object detection to land a multi‑rotor VTOL (Vertical Take‑off and
                     Landing) vehicle into a moving confined space.
        - Worked on an object detection algorithm based on YOLO, to enable the multi‑rotor VTOL vehicle to land into the moving platform of 1 square
                     meter area, within 60 sec of being detected.

      year: Feb 2022
      description: 
        - Developed a program to recognize hand gestures in 3D space using a single low‑resolution camera to display American Sign Language (ASL)
          as English Letters in real‑time.
        - Trained the model on YOLO and used the trained model with OpenCV, to recognize the hand gesture and predicting ASL letter.
