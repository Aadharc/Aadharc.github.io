  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

title={Investigation of Temperature Distribution inside the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) during the Drop to Idle Test (DTIT) Performed at Steady-State and Worst-Case Driving Cycles},

abstract={The present work investigates the temperature distribution inside the diesel particulate filter (DPF) regeneration during the drop to idle test (DTIT), which is considered as life-threatening to the DPF. To study this scenario in detail, experiments were carried out with the filter volume of 3 liters. Initially, the experiments were done at a steady-state level, where the optimization for optimal soot loading was performed with setpoint temperature varying from 620 to 660°C. The soot loading was varied from 8 g/l to 11 g/l. The DTIT performed at a steady-state level indicated the different peak temperatures attained inside the DPF at different locations. The peak temperature was found to be in the center plane of the filter. The next peak temperature locations were found to be in downstream of the filter at different locations, which shows the non-uniformity in the soot deposition inside the filter. The temperature gradient was estimated based on the measured peak temperature and was higher at the center plane of the filter. The different soot loading and the setpoint temperature were correlated for different cases. The importance of selecting the optimal soot loading and setpoint temperature were discussed. The time taken from the start of idle speed to reach the peak temperature from the DTI test suggests the importance of the setpoint temperature, which is evident from the fact that it is promoting the burning rate of the accumulated soot with a higher setpoint. Decreasing the soot loading with relaxing the setpoint temperature can be a better option to operate the DPF in the safe zone and to avoid the failure of the DPF. A similar study was carried out at the vehicle level at different operating conditions. The temperature distribution inside the DPF in different worst-case driving maneuvers was measured.}
